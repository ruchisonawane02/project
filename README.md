Automation with Jenkins and Docker-Container In Machine Learning or Deep Learning, data scientists need to change the model several times to find the best accuracy model manually. This took a lot of time and man power for making a machine learning or deep learning model precisely. In data science, there is no shortage of cool stuff to do the shiny new algorithms to throw at data. Now we can Find best accuracy model automatically by integrating with Jenkins and Docker-Container.
